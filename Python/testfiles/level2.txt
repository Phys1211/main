"In 2023, the number of developers worldwide was estimated to be over 26 million. Many developers, about 40 percent, work in software development companies. Some start learning programming at a young age, often around 10 or 12 years old. They typically learn basic concepts like loops, variables, and functions first. As they progress, they move on to more complex topics like algorithms, data structures, and optimization. By the time they reach 25 years old, many have already written thousands of lines of code. Practice and patience, as they say, are key to mastering any skill."
