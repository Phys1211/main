    "# Drawing from Probability Distributions\n",
    "A key part of any Monte Carlo simulation is drawing random numbers from known distributions. We model certain physical systems according to various statistical behaviors characterized by probability distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Drawing from non-uniform random distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we learned how to generate random numbers from\n",
    "a uniform probability distribution in an interval $[a,b]$. This\n",
    "distribution was normalized, so that $$\\int _a^b {P(x)dx}=1.$$ Hence, the uniform distribution *by definition* is\n",
    "$P(x)=1/(b-a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we generate a sequence $\\{x_i\\}$ and we take some\n",
    "function of it to generate $\\{y(x_i)\\}=\\{y_i\\}$. This new sequence is\n",
    "going to be distributed according to some probability density $P(y)$,\n",
    "such that $$P(y)dy=P(x)dx$$ or $$P(y)=P(x)\\frac{dx}{dy}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to generate a desired normalized distribution $P(y)$ from a uniform distribution $P(x)$, we need\n",
    "to solve the differential equation: $$\\frac{dx}{dy}=P(y).$$ But the\n",
    "solution of this is $$x=\\int _0^y {P(y')dy'}=F(y).$$ $F(y)$ is often called the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). Therefore,\n",
    "$$y(x)=F^{-1}(x),$$ where $F^{-1}$ is the inverse of $F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Exponential distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let us take $y(x)=-\\ln{(x)}$ with $P(x)$ representing a\n",

This connection makes physical sense: both describe resonance phenomena where the uncertainty principle relates the width of the distribution to the lifetime of the state.
