    "# Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, the fundamental laws of nature are expressed as differential equations. Newton's second law, Maxwell's equations, Schrödinger's equation - they all tell us how physical quantities *change* rather than what they *are*. When you write $F = ma = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$, you're not directly finding the velocity $v(t)$ - you're finding how velocity changes with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your calculus courses, you learned analytical techniques for solving simple differential equations. But the vast majority of physics problems cannot be solved with pencil and paper. Real-world differential equations are:\n",
    "- **Nonlinear** - Air resistance proportional to $v^2$, not $v$\n",
    "- **Coupled** - Multiple variables affecting each other simultaneously  \n",
    "- **Complex** - No closed-form solution exists\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where *numerical methods* become essential. Instead of finding an exact formula $y(t)$, we'll compute approximate values at discrete time points: $y(t_0), y(t_1), y(t_2), \\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Numerical ODE Solvers Matter in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations appear throughout physics:\n",
    "- **Classical Mechanics**: Projectile with air resistance, planetary orbits, coupled oscillators\n",
    "- **Thermodynamics**: Heat transfer, cooling and heating processes\n",
    "- **Electromagnetism**: RC/RL/RLC circuits, electromagnetic wave propagation\n",
    "- **Quantum Mechanics**: Time evolution of wave functions (Schrödinger equation)\n",
    "- **Fluid Dynamics**: Weather prediction, ocean currents, aerodynamics\n",
    "- **Population Dynamics**: Epidemiology, predator-prey systems, chemical reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple pendulum has the equation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For small angles, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and we can solve it analytically. But for large swings, the nonlinearity $\\sin\\theta$ makes analytical solutions impossible. Numerical methods handle both cases with equal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Previous Material\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Numerical Differentiation**: Remember how we approximated derivatives using finite differences?\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} \\approx \\frac{y(x+h) - y(x)}{h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That was our starting point: given a function, find its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Numerical Integration**: We learned to compute:\n",
    "$$\\int_a^b f(x)dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i f(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That took us from a rate of change to accumulated quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now with ODEs**: We're solving the *inverse problem* of differentiation:\n",
    "$$\\text{Given: } \\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y) \\quad \\text{Find: } y(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how $y$ changes, and we want to reconstruct $y$ itself. It's like integration, but more complex because the rate of change $f$ can depend on both $x$ *and* $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The General First-Order ODE\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on *first-order ordinary differential equations*:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the *dependent variable* (what we're solving for)\n",
    "- $x$ is the *independent variable* (typically time in physics)\n",
    "- $f(x,y)$ is the *derivative function* or rate of change\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need an initial condition: $y(x_0) = y_0$. This tells us where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Higher-order equations can always be rewritten as systems of first-order equations. For example:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = f(x, y, \\frac{dy}{dx})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be rewritten as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = v, \\quad \\frac{dv}{dx} = f(x, y, v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So once we learn to solve first-order equations, we can handle any higher order differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll develop three key methods, each building on the previous:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Euler's Method** - The simplest approach, extending our finite difference ideas\n",
    "2. **Runge-Kutta Methods** - More sophisticated, achieving better accuracy\n",
    "3. **Systems of ODEs** - Handling multiple coupled equations simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll use **Newton's Law of Cooling** as our primary example because:\n",
    "- It has physical meaning (temperature of cooling coffee!)\n",
    "- The math is straightforward enough to see what's happening\n",
    "- We can compare to the exact solution to verify our methods\n",
    "- It introduces the key concepts without overwhelming complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll tackle a more complex example: the **Predator-Prey System** (foxes and rabbits), which demonstrates how coupled nonlinear equations produce rich, oscillatory behavior that emerges naturally from simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll see how Python's `scipy` library provides professional-grade ODE solvers that build on these same fundamental ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Strategy: Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "All numerical ODE methods follow the same basic strategy:\n",
    "We'll replace derivatives with **finite differences**:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{x_{n+1} - x_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts the differential equation into an **update rule**: starting from $y_n$, how do we compute $y_{n+1}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods use different update rules, trading off:\n",
    "- **Accuracy** - How close to the true solution?\n",
    "- **Stability** - Does the error grow or stay bounded?\n",
    "- **Computational cost** - How many function evaluations per step?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good news**: Unlike numerical differentiation (which amplifies noise), ODE solvers tend to be stable. Small errors in one step don't necessarily ruin the entire solution. The integration-like nature of solving ODEs has a smoothing effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the simplest method: Euler's Method.\n",

    "# Euler’s method\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's method is the simplest numerical approach to solving ODEs, and it builds directly on the concept of **finite differences** from numerical differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: If we know $y$ at some point $x_n$, and we know the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$, we can approximate $y$ at the next point $x_{n+1}$ by assuming the derivative stays constant over a small interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the definition of a derivative:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{y(x + \\Delta x) - y(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **small but finite** $\\Delta x$, we approximate:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} \\approx \\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x_n, y_n)$, we can rearrange to find:\n",
    "$$y_{n+1} - y_n \\approx f(x_n, y_n) \\Delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the **Euler method update formula**:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{y_{n+1} = y_n + f(x_n, y_n) \\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric interpretation**: At each point, we follow the tangent line (whose slope is $f(x_n, y_n)$) for a small distance $\\Delta x$. Then we recalculate the slope and take another small step. We're essentially \"walking along the tangent lines.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Error**: Each step introduces an error of order $O(\\Delta x^2)$ because we're using a first-order Taylor approximation (keeping only the linear term).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Error**: After $N$ steps covering a total interval, the accumulated error grows to $O(\\Delta x)$. This means:\n",
    "- To cut the error in half, you need to **halve the step size**\n",
    "- To get 10× better accuracy, you need **10× more steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear error growth is why Euler's method, while simple to understand and implement, is not always the best choice for serious computation. But it's the starting point that gets us further than you would think.\n",

    "**RK4 strategy**:\n",
    "1. Evaluate slope at the **start** → gives $k_1$\n",
    "2. Use $k_1$ to estimate slope at **first midpoint** → gives $k_2$  \n",
    "3. Use $k_2$ (the improved midpoint estimate) to re-estimate slope at **second midpoint** → gives $k_3$\n",
    "4. Use $k_3$ to estimate slope at the **end** → gives $k_4$\n",
    "5. Take a **weighted average** of all four slopes, emphasizing the midpoint estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**: By sampling multiple times and refining estimates, RK4 captures how the solution curves through the interval with remarkable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical note**: RK4 was developed by German mathematicians Runge (1895) and Kutta (1901). Despite being over 120 years old, it's still one of the most widely used numerical methods in science and engineering!\n",
