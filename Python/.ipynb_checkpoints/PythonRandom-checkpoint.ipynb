    "nature, and reproducing or simulating naturally random processes is a\n",
    "particularly delicate matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is how to use a computer to generate random numbers. In\n",
    "fact, this is impossible! We can program a computer to generate a\n",
    "sequence of numbers, following certain law. Although the output values\n",
    "of this sequence might look random (according to some rules that we will\n",
    "discuss in this section), the existence of a deterministic law behind\n",
    "them is telling us that precisely, these are not random numbers at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "**We define a sequence of numbers $\\{r_1,r_2,...r_n\\}$ as “random” if\n",
    "there are no correlations among the numbers in the sequence.** A random\n",
    "sequence can have a distribution, <span>*i. e.*</span> the probability\n",

    "probability of finding $r_i$ in the interval $[r,r+dr]$ is given by\n",
    "$P(r)dr$. The usual random number generators provided by compilers or\n",
    "libraries generate a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, that means\n",

    "if you look hard enough, you will eventually figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pseudo-random number generators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will simply review some possible alternatives for\n",
    "pseudo-random number generators. These go from the simplest\n",
    "“congruential” or “power residue” algorithm to more sophisticated ones\n",
    "that can be found in the literature. We will limit ourselves to\n",
    "understand this simple example. We want to generate a sequence $\\{r_i\\}$\n",
    "over an interval $[0,M-1]$. You multiply the previous random number\n",
    "$r_i$ by a constant $a$, add on another constant $c$, take the modulus\n",
    "by $M$, and then keep just the fractional part, the reminder, as the\n",
    "next random number $r_{i+1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{i+1}=(ar_i+c)\\mathrm{mod}{M}=\\mathrm{remainder}\\left(\\frac{ar_i+c}{M}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $r_1$ has to be supplied by the user, and it is called the\n",
    "“seed” of the sequence. The sequence will be uniquely pre-determined by\n",
    "the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let us pick $c=1$, $a=4$, $M=9$ and $r_1=3$. We obtain the\n",

    "would divide these values by $M$. This algorithm is extremely simple and\n",

    "largest possible integer that can be used. However, there are ways to\n",
    "work around this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to generate\n",
    "independent sequences is to use the internal clock of the computer to\n",

    "## Period\n",
    "\n",
    "The period of a general linear congruantial generator (LCG) is at most $M$, and for some choices of factor a much less than that. The LCG will have a full period for all seed values if and only if:\n",
    "\n",

    "- $a - 1$ is divisible by all prime factors of $M$\n",
    "- $a - 1$ is divisible by 4 if $M$ is divisible by 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three requirements are referred to as the *Hull-Dobell Theorem*. While LCGs are capable of producing pseudorandom numbers which can pass formal tests for randomness, this is extremely sensitive to the choice of the parameters $c$, $M$, and $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, poor choices had led to ineffective implementations of LCGs. A particularly illustrative example of this is RANDU, which was widely used in the early 1970s and led to many results which are currently being questioned because of the use of this poor LCG.\n",
